# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Structure API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Structure API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [API Tokens](https://www.structure.ac/api_tokens).
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Structure offers clients for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the Structure JavaScript SDK
npm install @structure_ac/structure --save
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Structure Python SDK
pip install structure_ac
```

```bash {{ language: 'php' }}
# Install the Structure PHP SDK
composer require structure/sdk
```

```bash {{ language: 'ruby' }}
# Install the Structure Ruby SDK
gem install structure_ac
```

```bash {{ language: 'go' }}
# Install the Structure Go SDK
go get structure_ac
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/sdks"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Check out our list of first-party SDKs"
  />
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Structure API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Person endpoint to get an enriched profile from a linkedin person key.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/people">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://www.structure.ac/v1/people/stevejobs\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@structure_ac/structure'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.person.find('stevejobs')
```

```python
from structure_ac import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.person.find('stevejobs')
```

```php
$client = new \Structure\ApiClient($token);

$client->person->find('stevejobs');
```

```ruby
client = Structure::Client.new(api_key: ENV["STRUCTURE_API_KEY"])

client.person.find('stevejobs')
```

```go
client := structure.NewAuthClient("structure_api_token")

p, _ := client.GetPerson('stevejobs')
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/people"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the People endpoint"
  />
</div>
