# Pagination

In this guide, we will look at how to work with paginated responses when querying the Structure API. By default, all responses limit results to 50. However, you can go as high as 100 by adding a `limit` parameter to your requests. If you are using one of the official Protocol API client libraries, you don't need to worry about pagination, as it's all being taken care of behind the scenes. {{ className: 'lead' }}

When an API response returns a list of objects, no matter the amount, pagination is supported. In paginated responses, objects are nested in a `data` attribute and have a `total` attribute that indicates whether you have reached the end of the last page. You can use the `offset` and `per_page` query parameters to browse pages.

## Example using cursors

<Row>
  <Col>

    In this example, we request the page that starts after the conversation with id `s4WycXedwhQrEFuM`. As a result, we get a list of three conversations and can tell by the `has_more` attribute that we have reached the end of the resultset.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="per_page" type="integer">
        Limit the number of items returned. (10-50). Default is 50.
      </Property>
      <Property name="offset" type="integer">
        The offset of the pagination. Default is 0.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  <Col>

    ```bash {{ title: 'Manual pagination using cURL' }}
    curl -G https://www.structure.ac/api/v1/company/microsoft/employees\
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
      -d starting_after="s4WycXedwhQrEFuM" \
      -d per_page=50
      -d offset=50
    ```

    ```json {{ title: 'Paginated response' }}
    {
      "has_more": false,
      "employees": [
        {
          "name": "William Gates",
          // ...
        },
        {
          "name": "Bob"
          // ...
        },
        {
          "name": "Joe"
          // ...
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>
