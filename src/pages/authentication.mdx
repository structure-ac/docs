# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Structure API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Structure offers authentication for your API requests with a token. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## OAuth2 with bearer token

Authentication with the Structure API is using OAuth2. When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [Structure dashboard](https://www.structure.ac/api_tokens) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://www.structure.ac/v1/people/stevejobs\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.

## Using an SDK

If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the [Structure dashboard](https://www.structure.ac/api_tokens) under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
